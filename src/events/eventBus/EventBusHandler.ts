/**
 * This class listens to events emitted by the application. When the
 * class is instantiated, iterates over entries in an internal mapping
 * of event name to handler function, and registers the handler function
 * as a listener on the given event name. The payload returned by the
 * handler function is asynchronously sent to the Event Bus described
 * in the application config file.
 *
 * To handle a new event, you need not update this class directly. Instead,
 * add a payload builder function to EventBusConfig.ts and update the
 * mapping of event name to payload builder in that file.
 *
 * Error Handling:
 *  Any error that occurs when either building the payload or sending the
 *  event to EventBridge will be sent to Sentry and logged in Cloudwatch.
 *  No errors are thrown directly.
